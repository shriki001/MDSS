Files:run.py, icon.png, csv file('s) as u wish
how to run: must have python interpreter installed on the computer!
open python IDE (we use PyCharm by JetBrain) right click on "run.py" -> run
or open terminal (bash, CMD, PowerShell) navigate to the working directory and
run: "python run.py"
note: if there are no image 'icon.png' the program will not open and u need to
remove lines 103-104,
the db file must be csv file u can choose only that!
all the function was checked and work great!
GUI by python Tkinter


In addition,  we added folder called "Image Files",
that contains all the questions and guides how to use our program.
